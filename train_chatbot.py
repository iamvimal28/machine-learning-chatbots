#Creating Model

#The architecture of our model will be a neural network consisting of 3 dense layers. 
#The first layer has 128 neurons, the second one has 64 and the last layer will have the same 
#neurons as the number of classes. The dropout layers are introduced to reduce overfitting of the model. 
#We have used the SGD optimizer and fit the data to start the training of the model. 
#After the training of 200 epochs is completed, we then save the trained model using 
#the Keras model.save(“chatbot_model.h5”) function.

#Deep Neural Networks model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(128,input_shape=(len(train_x[0]),),activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(len(train_y[0]),activation='softmax'))

# Compiling model. SGD with Nesterov accelerated gradient gives good results for this model
sgd = SGD(lr=0.01,decay=1e-6,momentum=0.9,nesterov=True)
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',optimizer=sgd,metrics=['accuracy'])

#Training and saving the model
hist = model.fit(np.array(train_x),np.array(train_y),epochs=200,batch_size=5,verbose=1)
model.save('chatbot_model.h5', hist)
